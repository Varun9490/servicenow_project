# Automated Network Request Management in ServiceNow

**Category:** ServiceNow Application Developer
**Skills Required:** Service Level Management (SLA), Catalog Item Design, Workflow Configuration, Notifications, Approvals

## Project Overview
**Automated Network Request Management** project is designed to streamline and automate the handling of network-related service requests within **ServiceNow**.

It provides:
* A **self-service portal** for end users to submit network requests.
* Automated **workflows** for validation, approvals, and task assignment.
* Seamless integration with **network automation tools** (where applicable).
* Configurable **SLAs** to monitor and ensure timely fulfillment.
This solution reduces manual effort, improves response times, and enhances user satisfaction.

## Key Features
* **Service Catalog Items**
  * Predefined request forms for network-related services.
  * Easy-to-use portal interface for end users.
* **Workflow Automation**
  * Automated request validation and approvals.
  * Dynamic task assignment to appropriate teams.
* **Notifications & Approvals**
  * Real-time notifications at every stage of the request lifecycle.
  * Approval processes based on request type and cost.
* **Integration with Network Automation Tools** *(optional)*
  * Automatic execution of scripts/playbooks for standard requests.
  * Reduces dependency on manual interventions.
* **Service Level Management (SLM)**
  * SLA tracking for request fulfillment.
  * Escalation rules to prevent SLA breaches.
